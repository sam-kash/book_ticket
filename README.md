## Project Overview  
Book Ticket is a full-stack application enabling users to browse, select and book tickets for events, movies or travel (you can customize).  
Unlike a simple CRUD app, this project emphasises DevOps practices — CI/CD pipelines, containerisation, infrastructure as code, monitoring – so it’s both a functional product **and** a showcase of end-to-end engineering.  
This makes it ideal to demonstrate your full-stack + deployment proficiency at an interview.

## Features  
- User registration & login / authentication  
- Browse events or shows, view details  
- Select seat(s) and book tickets, with payment simulation  
- Admin panel to add/edit events (optional)  
- Real-time booking status updates  
- Automatic builds, deployments and monitoring via DevOps toolchain  
- Containerised micro-services (or modular monolith), easily scalable  

## Tech Stack  
| Layer          | Technologies                                          |

| Frontend       | React / Next.js, TypeScript, CSS/SCSS               |
| Backend        | Node.js (Express) or your chosen backend framework   |
| Database       | MongoDB / PostgreSQL                                  |
| Infrastructure | Docker, Kubernetes (or Docker Compose)               |
| CI/CD          | GitHub Actions (or similar)                          |
| Monitoring     | Prometheus + Grafana, or native cloud monitoring     |

*(Adjust the stack if you’re using different tools.)*

## Architecture & DevOps  
- Code lives in a mono-repo/workspace; front-end + back-end modules separated.  
- Dockerfile(s) for each service; compose or k8s manifests for orchestration.  
- CI pipeline: linting → unit tests → build → container image → deployment to staging/production.  
- Infrastructure as code (Terraform / CloudFormation) to define environment.  
- Logging & monitoring: aggregate logs, track metrics & alerts.  
- Quality gates: code coverage, static analysis, security scans.

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Node.js (>= 14) & npm or yarn/pnpm

- Git  
- Optional: cloud account if deploying to AWS/Azure/GCP  
- Environment variables file (.env) with variables like `DB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, etc.
